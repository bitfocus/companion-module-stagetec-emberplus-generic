Credits to the developers of the generic Ember+ module for the basis (https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-generic-emberplus)

## Getting started

Execute `yarn` command to install the dependencies.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn build:watch` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.
